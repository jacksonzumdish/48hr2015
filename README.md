# Swallow Theif

### Swallow
The inspiration was the darting flight of the *swallow*.

### Collapse
The way a *swallow* can *collapse* themselves to dive and dart through tight spaces seemed like an inspiring feeling to try to re-create in a game.
	
### Thief
The end-game of Swallow Thief, is to keep to its namesake and steal the crown. From who? The previous player, as a crown is only meaningful as long as there is someone willing to fight you for it.

**Technology and credits:**
The entire project runs in javascript, in a browser Chrome. The music, sequencer and level editor was created and coded completely from scratch. Sounds are is generated with jsfx.js. For the 3D environment and textures, three.js. For animation and timing, GSAP.

The game was built runs best in Chrome and has analogue controller support (the game also works with the arrow keys).

### Thank-you!
